# Protips on War XII: Bounties

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: PRO PLAYER KNOWLEDGE ⚠️**
This document contains strategic knowledge from veteran "pro players" in the NPAC Elite forum (2010-2014). While this represents deep meta-game understanding and proven competitive strategies, it should be treated as player-discovered mechanics and optimal strategies rather than definitive source code or exact truth. Use as reference for game design and balancing, but verify against actual game mechanics when implementing.

**Topic**: Bounty system optimization and strategic timing

## Overview

Bounties provide massive efficiency advantages in the current game state, offering superior turn-to-land ratios compared to traditional warfare. Strategic timing and claiming decisions can provide significant tactical advantages.

## Bounty Efficiency Analysis

### Sorcery Kill Example (30,000 acre realm)
- **Land Gained**: 9,000 acres (immediate claim)
- **Structures**: ~1,800 built structures (~20% built ratio)
- **Turn Savings**: 100+ turns at BR 18 equivalent
- **Advantage**: Sorcerers rarely gain this much land in traditional war

### Comparison to Traditional Warfare
- **Current State**: Land taken is at "low" level for general warriors
- **Bounty Value**: Almost even higher due to reduced war gains
- **Structure Quality**: Random structures vs minimally built war gains
- **Optimal Draw**: Quarries provide massive advantage

### Advanced Strategy: Shared Kills
- **Method**: Sorcerer achieves 95% kill, warrior finishes for land
- **Benefit**: Warrior gets fat while sorcerer claims bounty
- **Application**: Extremely useful for targeting NPC realms
- **Efficiency**: Double benefit from single target elimination

## Optimal Timing for Bounty Collection

### Tithing Threshold
- **Start Point**: After exhausting all tithing bonuses while building
- **Typical Range**: Between 11k-15k acres for most races
- **Signal**: When tithing no longer provides efficient land gains

### Environmental Assessment
- **Risk Evaluation**: Consider threat level before committing 250 turns for 4k acres
- **Current Meta**: ~3 major guilds, 3 minor guilds active
- **Opportunity Window**: When 2 of 3 major guilds are engaged in war
- **Strategic Timing**: Maximize "time off award" during others' conflicts

### War Dynamics Consideration
- **First Strike Advantage**: Attackers typically gain 1-2 big kingdoms
- **Competitive Response**: Bounties help maintain pace with war winners
- **Post-War Positioning**: Stay competitive for next conflict cycle

## Claiming Strategy

### Immediate Claiming (Default)
- **Standard Practice**: Claim bounties immediately upon collection
- **Benefit**: Immediate kingdom development and growth
- **Risk**: None under normal circumstances

### Strategic Holding
- **Defensive War Scenario**: Cannot protect newly claimed bounty
- **Hold Condition**: During active defensive operations
- **Recovery Options**: 
  1. Claim for kingdom recovery post-war
  2. Save for first strike "semi-secret weapon"

### Semi-Secret Weapon Concept
- **Tactical Advantage**: Unclaimed bounty provides unaccounted-for capability
- **Detection Risk**: Competent AGM of War/GM monitor kills constantly
- **Surprise Factor**: Major tactical advantage if undetected
- **Usage**: Deploy during critical first strike operations

## Strategic Applications

### Guild War Context
- **Preparation Phase**: Collect bounties during war buildup
- **First Strike**: Most effective deployment timing
- **Defensive Recovery**: Post-war kingdom restoration
- **Competitive Maintenance**: Keep pace with enemy gains

### Meta-Game Considerations
- **Guild Monitoring**: Track enemy bounty collection and claims
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Monitor unclaimed bounties for tactical planning
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance bounty hunting with war preparation
- **Timing Coordination**: Align bounty claims with guild strategy

## Current Game State Advantages

### Low Land Gains Environment
- **Warrior Limitation**: Traditional warfare yields minimal land
- **Bounty Premium**: Higher relative value due to reduced alternatives
- **Efficiency Gap**: Bounties provide superior land-per-turn ratio
- **Strategic Imperative**: Guilds "extremely foolish" not to collect and use

### Structure Benefits
- **Random Distribution**: Potential for high-value structure types
- **Built Percentage**: ~20% built vs minimal war gains
- **Turn Savings**: Significant building time reduction
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better return on turn investment

## Risk Management

### Threat Assessment
- **Environmental Awareness**: Know current guild war status
- **Timing Sensitivity**: Avoid collection before major conflicts
- **Protection Capability**: Ensure ability to defend claimed bounties
- **Strategic Patience**: Wait for optimal claiming windows

### Intelligence Considerations
- **Enemy Monitoring**: Assume opponents track your bounty status
- **Operational Security**: Minimize predictable patterns
- **Tactical Surprise**: Use unclaimed bounties for unexpected advantages
- **Communication**: Coordinate with guild leadership on timing

## Key Principles

1. **Efficiency Priority**: Bounties provide superior turn-to-land ratios
2. **Timing Critical**: Collect after tithing exhaustion, claim strategically
3. **Environmental Awareness**: Consider current guild war dynamics
4. **Strategic Flexibility**: Hold for tactical advantage when appropriate
5. **Intelligence Value**: Monitor enemy bounty collection and claims
6. **Resource Optimization**: Balance bounty hunting with other priorities
7. **Competitive Necessity**: Essential for maintaining guild competitiveness

The bounty system represents a fundamental shift in land acquisition efficiency, making traditional warfare secondary to strategic bounty collection and claiming in the current game environment.
