# Protips on War VIII: Parking Lots & Sorc Kills

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: PRO PLAYER KNOWLEDGE ⚠️**
This document contains strategic knowledge from veteran "pro players" in the NPAC Elite forum (2010-2014). While this represents deep meta-game understanding and proven competitive strategies, it should be treated as player-discovered mechanics and optimal strategies rather than definitive source code or exact truth. Use as reference for game design and balancing, but verify against actual game mechanics when implementing.

## Overview

Parking Lots (PL) destroy enemy buildings via sorcery, while Sorcery Kills (SK) eliminate peasant populations. Both tactics are crucial for demoralizing enemies and can be extremely effective in various war stages.

## Race Rankings for Sorcery Warfare

### Tier 1: Elite Sorcery Races

#### 1. Sidhe (Best Overall)
- **Hurricane**: 5.63% structures, 7.5% forts, 9% backlash
- **Lightning Lance**: 10% forts, 7% backlash  
- **Banshee Deluge**: 6.25% structures, 7% backlash
- **Advantage**: Lowest backlash rates, highest damage percentages

#### 2. Elven (Second Choice)

- **Lightning Lance**: 8.75% forts, 8% backlash
- **Banshee Deluge**: 5.0% structures, 8% backlash
- **Advantage**: Lower backlash than Vampire/Elemental, turn-intensive warriors

#### 3. Fae (Third Choice)  
- **Same damage as Elven**: 4.38%/6.25%/5.0%
- **Same backlash as Elven**: 10%/8%/8%
- **Consideration**: Stronger attackers than Elves, more versatile for warfare

### Tier 2: Moderate Sorcery Races

#### 4. Vampire (Fourth Choice)
- **Same damage as Elven/Fae**: 4.38%/6.25%/5.0%
- **Higher backlash**: 13%/11%/11%
- **Advantage**: Weaker warriors than Elemental, better scum protection

#### 5. Elemental (Fifth Choice)
- **Same damage as Vampire**: 4.38%/6.25%/5.0%  
- **Higher backlash**: 13%/11%/11%
- **Disadvantage**: Strong warriors better used for combat

#### 6. Human (Sixth Choice)
- **Hurricane**: 3.13% structures, 5% forts, 11% backlash
- **Lightning Lance**: 7.5% forts, 9% backlash
- **Banshee Deluge**: 3.75% structures, 9% backlash
- **Advantage**: Lower backlash than Vampire/Elemental despite less damage

### Tier 3: Emergency Sorcery Races
**Order**: Centaur > Dwarven > Goblin > Droben
- **Usage**: Only when desperate, requires significantly more turns
- **Ranking**: Based on scum strength vs warrior strength balance

## Parking Lot Strategy

### Pre-Attack Preparation
1. **Shield Breaking**: Always assume maximum shields
2. **Rousing Wind**: Use instead of Shattering Calm (lower backlash)
3. **Temple Assessment**: Estimate relative magical strength
4. **Target Analysis**: Evaluate fort/troop balance

### Spell Selection Strategy
- **Fort Heavy + Troop Light**: Start with Hurricane
- **Strong Defense**: Use Banshee Deluge exclusively  
- **Fort Only Realm**: Lightning Lance followed by warrior assault

### Detailed Parking Lot Example

**Target**: 21k acre Goblin realm (100% built)
- Smithies: 1,260, Dens: 1,890, Barracks: 8,822
- Mines: 6,300, Shrines: 1,680, Tunnels: 1,048
- Defenses: 3,300 Trolls, 10k Scamps
- Cash: 22,500,000

**Pre-Sorcery Preparation** (Human):
- Scout: 2 turns
- Burn Smithies (5 burns): 10 turns  
- Burn Shrines (14 burns): 28 turns
- Loot Cash (4 loots): 8 turns
- Intercept Caravans: 2 turns
- **Total**: 50 turns

**Post-Burn Status**:
- Remaining structures: 19,240 (18,192 non-forts)
- Smithies: 765, Shrines: 415
- Cash: 10,172,740

**Sorcery Phase** (Sidhe):
- Shield removal: 4 turns
- Hurricane x10: Forts 1,048→481, Structures 18,192→10,191
- Banshee Deluge x24: Structures 10,191→4,698
- **Final Result**: 5,179 total structures, <1k train rate
- **Total Sorcery**: 44 turns
- **Combined Effort**: 94 turns

### Turn Efficiency Analysis
- **Exchange Rate**: 2 attackers neutralize 3 enemy realms
- **Strategic Value**: Hardest target eliminated, others become vulnerable
- **Fog Consideration**: Sidhe can still marginalize 2 additional realms

## Sorcery Kill Strategy

### Objective
Complete peasant elimination for permanent realm removal (pre-restore era).

### Methodology
1. **Preparation**: Scout + burn shrines only (speed priority)
2. **Shield Removal**: Rousing Wind x2 (4 turns)
3. **Foul Light Spam**: 8% kill rate until peasant elimination

### Sorcery Kill Example
**Same 21k Goblin Target**:
- Pre-sorcery: 30 turns (scout + shrine burn)
- Shield removal: 4 turns  
- Foul Light: 130 turns (Sidhe) to eliminate 75,000 peasants
- **Total**: 164 turns for complete kill

### Risk Assessment
- **Online Opponent**: May inspire, wasting 150+ turns
- **Restore Timing**: Quick restore negates turn advantage
- **Resource Allocation**: Sorcerer must refort, limiting multi-target capability

## Combined Operations

### Scum + Sorcery + War Coordination
**Example**: 32k acre Elven realm
- **Centaur**: Burns 24 times (48 turns)
- **Sidhe**: Lightning Lance x15 (40 turns) reduces forts 2,600→535
- **Goblin**: Attacks with 2,200 Giants for easy land acquisition
- **Total Coordination**: 90+ turns for complete neutralization

### Multi-Phase Attack Benefits
- **Scum Phase**: Reduces defensive capabilities
- **Sorcery Phase**: Eliminates fortifications  
- **War Phase**: Easy land acquisition with minimal resistance

## Advanced Techniques

### Power Sorcery
**Usage**: When scum levels prevent temple access
- **Application**: Down-hit scenarios or age-end harassment
- **Effectiveness**: Hurricanes/Banshee Deluge always destroy something
- **Limitation**: Slow infrastructure drain, requires significant elan/time

### Spell Optimization
- **Hurricane**: Best for mixed targets (forts + structures)
- **Lightning Lance**: Specialized fort destruction
- **Banshee Deluge**: Maximum structure damage, fort-immune
- **Foul Light**: Peasant elimination only

## Strategic Applications

### First Strike Considerations
- **PL Preferred**: Turn efficiency for multiple targets
- **SK Risk**: High turn investment, single target focus
- **Guild Balance**: Similar-sized kingdoms favor PL approach

### Defensive Applications  
- **SK Priority**: Maximum enemy demoralization
- **Emotional Impact**: "Hurt their feelings" for land grabbing
- **Turn Investment**: Acceptable when preventing enemy consolidation

## Key Success Factors

### Race Selection
1. **Sidhe**: Optimal damage/backlash ratio
2. **Elven**: Best alternative when Sidhe unavailable
3. **Avoid**: Droben/Goblin/Centaur/Dwarven unless desperate

### Tactical Execution
1. **Shield Breaking**: Always use Rousing Wind first
2. **Spell Progression**: Hurricane→Banshee Deluge for PL
3. **Turn Management**: 200-300 structures/sorc for efficiency
4. **Coordination**: Combine with scum/war operations

### Risk Management
1. **Online Detection**: Monitor for opponent activity
2. **Backlash Mitigation**: Choose races with lower backlash rates
3. **Resource Protection**: Refort sorcerers after major operations
4. **Turn Allocation**: Balance between PL and SK based on strategic needs

## Historical Performance Example
**All-Elf Guild** (3 members, 90 days):
- **Sorcery Kills**: 2 complete eliminations
- **Forts Destroyed**: 8,500+
- **Buildings Demolished**: 250,000+
- **Average Realm Size**: 25,000 acres at 80-90% built

This demonstrates the devastating potential of coordinated sorcery warfare when properly executed with optimal race selection and tactical coordination.
