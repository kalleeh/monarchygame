# Protips on War X: In-Between Wars

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: PRO PLAYER KNOWLEDGE ⚠️**
This document contains strategic knowledge from veteran "pro players" in the NPAC Elite forum (2010-2014). While this represents deep meta-game understanding and proven competitive strategies, it should be treated as player-discovered mechanics and optimal strategies rather than definitive source code or exact truth. Use as reference for game design and balancing, but verify against actual game mechanics when implementing.

**Topic**: Managing guild preparation and player motivation between conflicts

## Overview

Managing the period between wars is as challenging as managing wartime itself. Player motivation, kingdom development, and strategic preparation during peacetime determine success in future conflicts.

## Player Motivation Management

### The Motivation Challenge
- **Post-Victory**: Easy to maintain motivation after successful wars
- **Post-Defeat**: Very difficult to keep players engaged after losses
- **Key Factor**: Player motivation drives chat attendance and active participation
- **GM Responsibility**: Maintaining guild morale and activity levels

### Common Player Issues
- **Inactivity**: Surviving war then abandoning kingdom for weeks
- **Guild Impact**: Inactive players set entire guild up for failure
- **Communication**: Players should inform GM of real-life issues before disappearing
- **Diplomatic Protection**: GM can negotiate temporary protection for inactive guilds

## In-Between War Definition

**Period**: Time between war conclusion/age start and next conflict
**Activities**: Building, saving cash, preparing defenses
**Objective**: Become the "hard target" that enemies avoid
**Timeline**: 2-3 build cycles plus one additional turn set recommended

## Strategic Preparation Framework

### War Scheduling
- **Advance Notice**: Next war should always be posted on banner/scribe
- **Guild Coordination**: Inform fellow faith guild leaders
- **Recommended Timeline**: 2-3 build cycles + 1 turn set between wars
- **Purpose**: Keep guild active and offensive rather than defensive

### Build Priority Sequence
1. **Build Rate**: Achieve 16-20 BR (optimal range)
2. **Temple Protection**: Sufficient temples to stop power sorcery kills
3. **Barracks Capacity**: Enough for proper refort after 1.5x land expansion
4. **Balanced Construction**: Mix of permanent and perishable structures

### Structure Categories
- **Permanent**: Barracks, Hovels, Quarries (survive attacks)
- **Perishable**: Guildhalls, Temples, Forts (vulnerable to destruction)

## Detailed Build Example

### Starting Position (Post-War Droben)
- **Land**: 27,357 acres
- **Build Rate**: 10 (inadequate)
- **Structures**: TimoTon 1,083, Baklavs 1,344, RumaNa 3,861, Waterfalls 5,261, Enclaves 1,250, Arches 763
- **Timeline**: 8 days to next war (150 turns reserved for war)
- **Available**: 6 days for building (~450 turns total)

### Turn Optimization Strategy
- **Encamp 24 hours**: +10 turns
- **Encamp 16 hours**: +7 turns  
- **Total Bonus**: 17 turns for faster accumulation
- **Open Acres**: 13,795 (requires BR 31 for 3-cycle completion)

### Build Cycle 1: Build Rate Improvement
- **Objective**: Increase BR from 10 to 14
- **Method**: Downsize defensive troops and scum for cash
- **Turns Used**: 136 turns (22 for BR 10→12, 114 for BR 12→14)
- **Result**: 6,849 Waterfalls, BR 14

### Build Cycle 2: Further BR Enhancement  
- **Objective**: Achieve BR 16
- **Turns Available**: 130 (20 reserved for refort)
- **Structures Needed**: 1,359 for BR 16
- **Turns Used**: 98 for Waterfalls, 32 for diversification
- **Additional**: 167 TimoTon, 156 Baklavs, 189 RumaNa
- **Result**: 8,212 Waterfalls, BR 16

### Build Cycle 3: War Preparation
- **Constraints**: Need cash AND structures
- **Reserved**: 18 turns refort, 32 turns Inspire Devotion
- **Available**: 100 turns for building (1,600 structures)
- **Allocation**: 237 Arches, 250 Enclaves, 1,113 RumaNa
- **Strategy**: Build RumaNa first, then Enclaves, then Arches
- **Cash Generation**: Inspire Devotion before building forts (expense management)

### Final Kingdom Status
- **Land**: 27,357 acres
- **Build Rate**: 16 (adequate)
- **Structures**: TimoTon 1,250, Baklavs 1,500, RumaNa 5,163, Waterfalls 8,212, Enclaves 1,500, Arches 1,000
- **Train Rate**: 3,000+ troops
- **Assessment**: Not perfect, but functional and war-ready

## Defensive Posture Guidelines

### Scum Protection Strategy
- **Objective**: Force top realms to be "seen" when scouting
- **Minimum**: Enough scum to detect maximum enemy scouts
- **Balance**: Maintain deterrent without over-investing

### Troop Allocation (Under 20k Acres)
- **50% Scum**: Detection and theft protection
- **50% Big Troops**: T3/T4 defensive units
- **Purpose**: Force enemies to "think twice" before attacking

### Troop Allocation (Over 20k Acres)  
- **Add T1/T2 Troops**: Prevent Guerrilla Raids on scum
- **Layered Defense**: Multiple defensive tiers
- **Flexibility**: Adjust based on threat assessment

## Additional Peacetime Activities

### Bounty Hunting
- **Sorcery Races**: Elves, Vampires, Fae, Sidhe
- **Method**: Traditional sorcery kills for bounty claims
- **Benefit**: Additional income and combat practice
- **Risk Management**: "Prevent forest fires" approach

### Community Engagement
- **Role Playing**: Character development threads
- **Forum Participation**: Strategic discussions and community building
- **Game Promotion**: Voting for Monarchy to increase player base
- **Networking**: Building relationships for future diplomatic needs

## Turn Management Principles

### Efficiency Maximization
- **Encamp Usage**: Strategic turn acceleration
- **Cash Flow**: Balance income generation with military needs
- **Structure Timing**: Build expensive structures when cash is available
- **Refort Planning**: Reserve adequate turns for military preparation

### Resource Allocation
- **Cash Priority**: Maintain war chest while building
- **Turn Distribution**: Balance building, military, and preparation
- **Structure Balance**: Permanent vs perishable based on threat level
- **Defensive Investment**: Adequate protection without over-commitment

## Guild Master Responsibilities

### Communication
- **War Scheduling**: Clear advance notice of next conflict
- **Expectation Setting**: Define build requirements and timelines
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track individual kingdom development
- **Motivation Maintenance**: Keep players engaged and active

### Strategic Coordination
- **Faith Diplomacy**: Coordinate with allied guild leaders
- **Threat Assessment**: Monitor potential enemies
- **Resource Planning**: Ensure guild-wide war readiness
- **Contingency Planning**: Prepare for various conflict scenarios

## Success Metrics

### Individual Kingdom Readiness
- **Build Rate**: 16-20 optimal range
- **Temple Count**: Sufficient for sorcery protection
- **Barracks**: Adequate for post-expansion refort
- **Cash Reserves**: War chest for operations
- **Defensive Capability**: Deterrent against casual attacks

### Guild Readiness
- **Participation**: High chat attendance and activity
- **Coordination**: Synchronized preparation timelines
- **Communication**: Clear understanding of roles and expectations
- **Morale**: Positive attitude and engagement levels

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Neglecting Build Rate**: Staying below optimal 16-20 range
- **Poor Communication**: Not informing GM of availability issues
- **Inactivity**: Abandoning kingdom after surviving wars
- **Imbalanced Building**: Over-investing in single structure types
- **Inadequate Defense**: Leaving kingdom vulnerable to opportunistic attacks
- **Poor Turn Management**: Wasting turns on inefficient activities
- **Lack of Preparation**: Not maintaining war readiness during peace

The key to successful in-between war management is maintaining player motivation while systematically preparing for the next conflict through efficient building, strategic defense, and clear communication.
