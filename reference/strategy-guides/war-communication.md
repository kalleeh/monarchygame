# Protips on War VI: Communication

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: PRO PLAYER KNOWLEDGE ⚠️**
This document contains strategic knowledge from veteran "pro players" in the NPAC Elite forum (2010-2014). While this represents deep meta-game understanding and proven competitive strategies, it should be treated as player-discovered mechanics and optimal strategies rather than definitive source code or exact truth. Use as reference for game design and balancing, but verify against actual game mechanics when implementing.

## Communication Hierarchy (Best to Worst)

### 1. Face-to-Face Communication
- **Ideal**: Direct personal interaction
- **Reality**: Rarely possible in online gaming
- **Exception**: Players who know each other personally

### 2. Telephonic Communication  
- **Advantage**: Voice inflection conveys meaning and emotion
- **Clarity**: Reduces misunderstandings common in text
- **Real-time**: Immediate feedback and clarification

### 3. Written Communication
- **Methods**: Email, Scribe, Personal Message, Banner, Forum threads
- **Challenge**: Reader interpretation without vocal cues
- **Risk**: Misunderstandings due to lack of context

### 4. Real-Time Chat Rooms
- **Purpose**: GM solution to overcome text communication obstacles
- **Critical**: Essential for war coordination
- **Benefits**: Team building and camaraderie

## War Chat Importance

### Attendance is Mandatory
- **Consequence**: Missing war chat = blind to strategy and role
- **Information Gap**: May receive orders but miss context
- **Team Building**: Lose camaraderie and coordination benefits

### Real-Time Tactical Advantages
- **Online Opponents**: Immediate threat during strikes
- **Counter-Strategy**: Cannot defend against all three attack forms simultaneously
- **Rapid Response**: Scummer burns cash/temples, followed by Parking Lot

## Leadership Communication Strategies

### Information Flow Frequency
- **Principle**: More information = better informed players
- **Result**: Increased regular participation and availability
- **Planning**: Advance war chat scheduling with maximum notice

### War Chat Preparation
- **Advance Notice**: Post schedules early for player preparation
- **Resource Planning**: Allows cash accumulation, structure building, turn maximization
- **Personal Coordination**: Players can inform GMs of availability conflicts

### Two-Way Communication Model
- **Workplace Parallel**: Successful guilds mirror successful workplaces
- **Personal Boundaries**: Don't need personal life details
- **Availability Windows**: Critical for strike planning with limited players
- **Full Participation**: Can determine success vs failure

### Rogue Operations Protocol
- **Consultation Required**: Discuss with GM before independent operations
- **Risk Assessment**: Initiative may trigger unwanted guild wars
- **Coordination**: Prevent accidental escalation

## Leadership Structure Communication

### GM Delegation
- **Rhythm Establishment**: Leaders should know and follow GM patterns
- **Example**: Week-long war preparation timeline
- **Empowerment**: AGM of War handles prep work and target selection
- **Load Distribution**: Reduce GM workload through delegation

### Junior Leader Development
- **Clear Roles**: Define responsibilities for subordinate leaders
- **Authority**: Give junior leaders decision-making power
- **Support**: Provide guidance while allowing autonomy

## New Player Communication

### Assessment Phase
- **Background**: Where are they from?
- **Experience**: How long have they played?
- **Preferences**: What type of realm interests them?

### Guidance Approach
- **Educational**: Explain WHY certain approaches work
- **Avoid**: Simply telling them what to do without context
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Commend efforts and progress
- **Avoid Berating**: Negative feedback leads to guild/game departure
