**Topic**: Optimal guild composition and race selection strategy

## Overview

Guild composition should balance versatility, unpredictability, and stage-of-age effectiveness. Each race has specific strengths and weaknesses that must be considered for 8-realm guild optimization.

## Core Race Analysis

### Human (Best Overall Race)
- **Rating**: Scum 4/5, War 3/5, Sorcery 3/5
- **Strengths**: Most balanced, best late-game race, ultimate adventurer
- **Special Ability**: Multiple caravan sending (bypasses sabotage)
- **Versatility**: Effective offensive and defensive at all stages
- **Building Speed**: Fastest or tied for fastest construction
- **Weakness**: Early game vulnerability to Goblins

### Elven (Quintessential Wizard)
- **Rating**: Sorcery 4/5, Defense 4/5
- **Strengths**: Versatile from 8k to 40k acres, remains threat with temples/elan
- **Special Ability**: Guild-wide fog casting (Level 5 spell)
- **Critical Role**: Essential for land-fat realms (65k acres, <4% temples)
- **Defense Strategy**: 8% forts, 80% scum, 20% T1/T4 troops
- **Weakness**: Poor warfare capability

### Goblin (Traditional Warrior)
- **Strengths**: Powerful early age, cheap Giants, strong forts (285 defense)
- **Special Ability**: Kobold rage in middle age
- **Decline**: Becomes less viable late age due to weak scum/sorcery
- **Cost Comparison**: 25k Goblin scum = 30k Human scum cost
- **Vulnerability**: Scum/sorcery combinations in late age

## Specialist Race Analysis

### Droben (Best Warrior)
- **Strengths**: Bunar units excel, 3%+ networth summoning capability
- **Performance**: Can break 4-6 realms in single strike
- **Risk**: Too many makes guild predictable and vulnerable
- **Scum**: Average protection in mid-late game
- **Recommendation**: Include at least one per guild

### Sidhe (True Sorcerer)
- **Efficiency**: Sorcery kill in <150 turns
- **Capability**: Parking Lot 3 realms in one strike
- **Bounty Synergy**: Huge benefit with bounty system
- **Power Level**: Can clear path or create one
- **Extreme Strategy**: 6 Sidhe + 2 Human guild consideration

### Elemental (Fighter Mage)
- **Strengths**: Excellent fort destruction, good troop training
- **Defense**: Cherufe effective early-middle age
- **Weaknesses**: Weak late-age scum, weaker forts, high backlash
- **Temple Requirement**: 16% temples recommended for full abilities
- **Synergy**: Demons anchor Droben ground attacks

### Fae (Druid Archetype)
- **Balance**: Good offensive sorcery, war, decent scum
- **Comparison**: Similar skill set to Elemental
- **Assessment**: Interchangeable with Elemental
- **Versatility**: Well-rounded capabilities

### Centaur (Specialist Scummer)
- **Problem**: Only 0.005% better scum than Human
- **Trade-off**: Far worse sorcery and war abilities
- **Predictability**: Obviously scum-focused, easy target
- **Vulnerability**: "Roll me, I'm the eyeball" syndrome
- **Verdict**: Human preferred 10/10 times

### Vampire (Selfish Race)
- **Ratings**: Sorcery 4/5, War 3/5, Scum 4/5
- **Strengths**: Awesome forts
- **Requirements**: 8% forts + defensive troops (Mullo) + scum
- **Problem**: Needs twice the cash of other races
- **Risk**: 3/4 age investment hoping to reach scroll top
- **Assessment**: Too resource-intensive for guild play

### Dwarven (Worst Race)
- **Problems**: Ineffective scum, low sorcery, vulnerable to PL/SK
- **Troop Issues**: Best troops are T2/T3 (turn-intensive conversion)
- **Performance**: Builds slower, trains slower, dies quickest
- **Counter**: Simple parking lot and sorcery kill solution
- **Verdict**: Offers nothing useful to guild warfare

## Optimal Guild Compositions

### Core Three Races (Simplified)
- **2x Elven**: Sorcery and fog capability
- **2x Goblin**: Early-age punch power
- **4x Human**: Versatile jack-of-all-trades

**Strike Capability**: 1 Human + 2 Elves eliminate 4 realms first strike
**Result**: 5 vs 4 advantage in warfare phase

### Ideal 8-Realm Guild (All Races Available)
1. **1x Sidhe**: Strong scummer, serious sorcerer
2. **1x Elven**: Guild fog, parking lots, moderate scum protection
3. **1x Droben**: Primary realm breaker
4. **1x Goblin**: Land taker and exploiter
5. **2x Human**: Jack-of-all-trades, good scummers
6. **2x Elemental**: Fighter-mage combination

**Capabilities**: 6 Sorcerers, 6 Warriors, 3 Scummers
**Benefit**: Maximum versatility and unpredictability

## Strategic Considerations

### Age Stage Effectiveness
- **Early Age**: Goblin dominance, Human building speed
- **Middle Age**: Elemental fighter-mage, Kobold rage
- **Late Age**: Human versatility, Sidhe sorcery power

### Guild Balance Factors
- **Versatility**: Multiple tactical options available
- **Unpredictability**: Varied race composition confuses enemies
- **Specialization**: Each race fills specific strategic role
- **Resource Efficiency**: Balanced cash and turn requirements

### Avoided Strategies
- **All-Human Guild**: Too predictable, limited despite balance
- **Too Many Specialists**: Creates vulnerabilities and predictability
- **Resource-Heavy Races**: Vampire-type races drain guild resources

## Race Synergies

### Offensive Combinations
- **Droben + Elemental**: Demon anchors for Bunar attacks
- **Sidhe + Human**: Sorcery clearing path for versatile follow-up
- **Goblin + Human**: Early punch with adaptable exploitation

### Defensive Combinations
- **Elven Fog**: Protects entire guild's land-fat realms
- **Human Scum**: Reliable detection and protection
- **Elemental Forts**: Strong defensive anchoring

### Support Functions
- **Human Caravans**: Bypass sabotage for resource distribution
- **Sidhe Bounties**: Economic benefit from sorcery kills
- **Elven Temples**: Long-term magical sustainability

## Key Principles

1. **Balance Over Specialization**: Avoid too many of any single race
2. **Stage Consideration**: Plan for early, middle, and late age effectiveness
3. **Unpredictability**: Varied composition prevents enemy preparation
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Consider cash and turn requirements
5. **Synergy Maximization**: Combine races that support each other
6. **Flexibility**: Maintain multiple tactical options
7. **Proven Performance**: Base decisions on demonstrated effectiveness

The ideal guild composition balances immediate tactical needs with long-term strategic flexibility while maintaining the unpredictability that prevents enemies from developing effective counter-strategies.
