**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: PRO PLAYER KNOWLEDGE ⚠️**
This document contains strategic knowledge from veteran "pro players" in the NPAC Elite forum (2010-2014). While this represents deep meta-game understanding and proven competitive strategies, it should be treated as player-discovered mechanics and optimal strategies rather than definitive source code or exact truth. Use as reference for game design and balancing, but verify against actual game mechanics when implementing.

## Warrior Race Merit List (Best to Worst)

### Tier 1: Elite Warriors
1. **Droben** - Best overall warrior race
   - **Bunar**: Most explosive offensive unit (27.50 attack value, T3)
   - **Best Summon**: 3.04% of total networth in Green T1 troops
   - **T1 Guerrilla**: 25.0 attack value for raids
   - **Example**: 1M networth = 30,400 summoned troops

2. **Elemental** - Second best warrior
   - **War Offense**: 4 (tied with Goblin/Dwarven)
   - **T4 Advantage**: Easiest unit to train has best attack value in tier
   - **Summon**: 2.84% (second best)
   - **Efficiency**: More turns on target, less on training

3. **Goblin** - Edges Dwarven for efficiency
   - **War Offense**: 4 (tied)
   - **T4 vs T3**: Goblin T4 (22.50) vs Dwarf T3 (22.50) - saves turns
   - **Summon**: 2.75% (tied with Dwarven)
   - **Growth**: Better Offer ability = faster kingdom growth
   - **Example**: 13.5k acres vs Dwarf 11.5k acres after conversion

4. **Dwarven** - Solid warrior, slightly less efficient
   - **War Offense**: 4 (tied)
   - **T3 Training**: Requires more turns than Goblin T4
   - **Summon**: 2.75% (tied with Goblin)

### Tier 2: Moderate Warriors
5. **Vampire** - Middle-tier warrior
   - **T4 Cost**: Slightly cheaper per unit than Fae
   - **Balanced**: Neither exceptional nor poor

6. **Fae** - Close to Vampire
   - **Sorcery**: Better magical abilities than Vampire
   - **Trade-off**: Slightly more expensive T4 units

7. **Human** - Economic warrior
   - **Advantage**: Better Summon than Centaur
   - **T4 Dragons**: Easier to train than Centaur T3 Minotaurs
   - **Turn Efficiency**: More turns saved = more enemy deaths

### Tier 3: Poor Warriors
8. **Centaur** - Limited offensive capability
   - **T3 Minotaurs**: Harder to train than Human T4
   - **Summon**: Weaker than Human

9. **Elven** - Barely viable warrior
   - **Attack Value**: At least has units over 20.0 attack
   - **Limited**: Not ideal for realm breaking

10. **Sidhe** - Worst warrior race
    - **Attack Values**: No units with strong offensive capability
    - **Role**: Better suited for other game aspects

## Breaking Strategy Framework

### Pre-Attack Assessment
1. **Always Assume Ambush**: Opponent likely has defensive measures
2. **Ambush Removal**: Use Guerrilla Raid or Full Attack during conversion
3. **Cash Conservation**: Remove ambush before committing major forces
4. **Allied Coordination**: Ensure allies aren't supporting when you FA (prevents massacre)

### Controlled Strike Progression
1. **CS1 with Summon**: Continue until "with ease" twice in a row
2. **CS100 with Summon**: Continue until "with ease" twice in a row  
3. **Full Attack**: Should start with success after proper CS preparation
4. **Logic**: Better attack rating = higher percentage of land taken

### The "Rule of 0.25%" - Cash Conservation
**Principle**: After breaking realm to "with ease", reduce troops by 25% each attack

**Example Progression** (Human Dragons):
- Start: 4,000 T4 Dragons
- Attack 1: 3,000 (25% reduction)
- Attack 2: 2,250 (25% reduction)  
- Attack 3: 1,688 (25% reduction)
- Continue: 1,266 → 950 → 713...

**Benefits**:
- Maintains "with ease" results
- Conserves cash through reduced army size
- Maximizes land percentage taken

**Risks**:
- More time between attacks
- Vulnerable to opponent ambush if they return

## Advanced Summon Tactics

### Networth Inflation Strategy
**Components that increase networth**:
1. **Cash reserves**
2. **T1 Buildings/Guildhalls** (inflate networth more than temples/quarries)

**Tactic**: Send large cash reserves to Droben with extra Guildhalls
**Result**: Massive summon capability for devastating attacks
**Risks**: 
- Vulnerability to burning (T1 buildings)
- Vulnerability to looting (cash)

## Multi-Realm Attack Strategies

### "Pass the Plate" Method
1. **Big Warrior**: Cracks realm to first "with ease" Full Attack
2. **Handoff**: Pass target to next biggest warrior
3. **Distribution**: Continue until all warriors get land
4. **Usage**: Typically second war chat, not first strike
5. **Defense Application**: Maximum destruction when defending

### Anchored Defense Counter
**Problem**: Defensive realms supporting each other
**Solution**: "Sabotage Alliances" 
1. **Scummer Action**: Break alliance support between attacks
2. **Individual Breaking**: Attack each realm separately  
3. **Efficiency**: Once "with ease" achieved, stop sabbing
4. **Mass Destruction**: Warrior drains all realms of troops

## Timing and Risk Management

### When to Stop Attacking
- **Optimal**: 30-40 turns remaining for refortification
- **Size Ratio**: When target is <1/5th your size (25k vs 5k acres)
- **Scum Protection**: Hire enough thieves to cover vulnerability
- **GM Supervision**: Guild Master must know when to call halt

### Ambush Considerations
- **95% Effectiveness**: Ambushes almost always stop armies
- **Guild Impact**: Especially devastating in guild warfare
- **Strategy**: Never try to "mob through" an ambush
- **Removal**: Always clear ambush before major assault

## Key Strategic Principles

1. **Race Selection**: Choose warrior race based on turn efficiency and summon capability
2. **Preparation**: Proper Controlled Strike progression before Full Attack
3. **Cash Management**: Use 0.25% rule to conserve resources while maintaining effectiveness
4. **Coordination**: Understand when to attack solo vs pass-the-plate
5. **Defense Breaking**: Use Sabotage Alliances against anchored defenses
6. **Risk Assessment**: Balance aggression with refortification needs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Attempting to mob through ambushes
- Skipping proper CS progression to Full Attack
- Not reducing army size after achieving "with ease"
- Poor timing on when to stop attacking
- Ignoring defensive alliance support
- Choosing inefficient warrior races for the strategy
