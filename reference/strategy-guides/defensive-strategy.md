# Protips on War VII: Defensive Strategy

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: PRO PLAYER KNOWLEDGE ⚠️**
This document contains strategic knowledge from veteran "pro players" in the NPAC Elite forum (2010-2014). While this represents deep meta-game understanding and proven competitive strategies, it should be treated as player-discovered mechanics and optimal strategies rather than definitive source code or exact truth. Use as reference for game design and balancing, but verify against actual game mechanics when implementing.

**Topic**: Three-phase defensive warfare strategy

## Overview

Defensive warfare is the most difficult position for guilds and guild masters. After being attacked, defenders must overcome emotion and execute strategic counterattacks to maximize damage while minimizing enemy gains.

## Three Phases of Defensive War

### Phase 1: The Unopposed First Strike

**Scenario**: Log in to find your guild devastated with no one online during the attack.

#### Immediate Response Protocol
1. **Emotional Control**: Take 5 minutes to process anger, then focus on strategy
2. **Emergency Guild Chat**: Call immediate meeting - speed is critical
3. **Turn Utilization**: Any realm with 80+ turns should attack immediately
4. **Time Pressure**: Every hour of delay allows enemy refortification and after-burning

#### Target Selection Strategy
- **Primary Targets**: Mid-size realms (guild's center force)
- **Avoid**: Top realms unless they refort poorly (massive turn waste)
- **Objective**: Influence enemy behavior to want peace more than you do

#### Tactical Priorities
1. **Sorcery Kills**: Remove players from combat for 48+ hours
2. **Parking Lots**: Immobilize high-value targets
3. **Land Disposal**: If taking land, dispose quickly (enemy will reclaim)
4. **Intercept Caravans**: Only on non-sorcery targets (turn efficiency)

#### Peace Negotiation Timing
- **Optimal Window**: Before enemy's second strike
- **Risk**: Delay allows dominant realms to grow uncontrollably
- **Strategic Consideration**: Restore mechanics favor quick resolution

### Phase 2: The In Between Strike

**Scenario**: Some enemy guild members participated in first strike, others did not.

#### Priority Target Selection
- **Primary**: Realms that haven't used turns yet
- **Benefit**: Creates mini-first strike advantage for defenders
- **Impact**: Removing one player from 8-realm guild = 300 turns out of fight

#### Strategic Advantage
- **Timeline**: Peace within 40 hours = land-fat warriors or decent bounties
- **Force Reduction**: Enemy operates with reduced numbers for 48 hours
- **Follow-up**: Same tactics as Phase 1 after eliminating fresh realms

### Phase 3: Your Online When it Goes Down Strike

**Scenario**: You're online with turns when enemy prepares to strike.

#### Detection Indicators
- **Networth Fluctuations**: Enemy realms changing rapidly
- **Forum Activity**: War declarations or preparation posts
- **Behavioral Changes**: Unusual activity patterns

#### Stealth Strategy
**Principle**: Remain anonymous as long as possible

**Attack Sequence**:
1. **Cash First**: Steal financial resources
2. **Intercept Caravans Second**: Disrupt resource flow  
3. **Temples Third**: Reduce magical capabilities
4. **Land Fourth**: Territory acquisition

#### Timing Advantage
- **Optimal Moment**: After enemy converts to pure offense
- **Vulnerability Window**: Enemy stuck with offensive troops
- **Enemy Response**: Usually turtle up and refort defensively
- **Turn Efficiency**: Enemy wastes 120+ turns, you lose ~70

#### Coordination Protocol
- **Communication**: Coordinate with other online players
- **Role Assignment**: Clear division of responsibilities
- **Cash Management**: Use immediately or dump quickly
- **Priority Order**: Parking Lot first (sorcerers), then dump cash

#### Historical Example
**Carlos Danger Scenario**: Two defenders online prevented 150k+ networth advantage guild from successful down-hit:
- **Initial Result**: 9 vs 11 attack, both sides lost 4 realms
- **Counter Result**: Enemy reduced to 2 working realms
- **Final Outcome**: All enemy realms wrecked/destroyed/restored by next night

## Advanced Defensive Tactics

### Resource Management
- **Downsizing Considerations**: Ensure ability to rebuild what you downsize
- **Anchor Strategy**: 60k acre Parking Lot Elemental with 2000 barracks has value
- **Scum Conservation**: Think strategically about what can be saved
- **Land Downsizing**: Only for guild benefit and maximum enemy disinterest

### Psychological Warfare
- **Persistence**: Don't quit - defensive wars can still lead to age victory
- **Reputation Building**: Make enemy regret the engagement
- **Future Deterrence**: Costly defense discourages future attacks
- **Fighting Spirit**: Make enemy know they were in a real fight

### Strategic Principles
1. **Emotion Control**: Logic over anger in decision-making
2. **Speed Priority**: Immediate response prevents enemy consolidation
3. **Turn Efficiency**: Use available resources immediately
4. **Target Selection**: Mid-size realms for maximum impact
5. **Peace Timing**: Before enemy second strike when possible
6. **Coordination**: Online presence during enemy strikes is decisive

## Key Success Factors

### Immediate Response
- **Guild Chat**: Emergency coordination within hours
- **Turn Usage**: 80+ turn realms attack immediately
- **Target Focus**: Mid-size realms for maximum disruption

### Tactical Execution
- **Sorcery Kills**: Remove players from 48-hour combat cycle
- **Parking Lots**: Immobilize high-value targets
- **Resource Denial**: Cash theft and caravan interception
- **Temple Destruction**: Reduce enemy magical capabilities

### Long-term Strategy
- **Reputation**: Make attacks costly to discourage future aggression
- **Persistence**: Continue fighting until resolution
- **Learning**: Each defensive war builds guild experience
- **Adaptation**: Adjust tactics based on enemy responses

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Emotional Decision-Making**: Anger leads to poor strategic choices
- **Delayed Response**: Waiting for "better timing" wastes opportunities
- **Wrong Targets**: Attacking top realms wastes turns
- **Poor Coordination**: Lack of communication reduces effectiveness
- **Premature Surrender**: Giving up before exploring all options
- **Resource Waste**: Downsizing without ability to rebuild

## Victory Conditions

**Defensive Success Metrics**:
- Enemy requests peace before second strike
- Significant enemy casualties relative to defender losses
- Enemy reputation damage for future conflicts
- Guild maintains fighting capability and morale
- Learning experience improves future defensive capabilities

**Remember**: You may not win every defensive war, but make the enemy pay a price that makes them think twice about future attacks.
