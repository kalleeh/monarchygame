# Protips on War IV: Finances

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: PRO PLAYER KNOWLEDGE ⚠️**
This document contains strategic knowledge from veteran "pro players" in the NPAC Elite forum (2010-2014). While this represents deep meta-game understanding and proven competitive strategies, it should be treated as player-discovered mechanics and optimal strategies rather than definitive source code or exact truth. Use as reference for game design and balancing, but verify against actual game mechanics when implementing.

**Topic**: Financial resource management during warfare

## Cash Generation Mechanics

### T1/T2 Building Synergy
- **T1 Buildings**: Markets, Guildhalls (primary cash generators)
- **T2 Buildings**: Hovels, Dens (population support)
- **Optimal Ratio**: Build T1 and T2 on a 1:1 basis for maximum efficiency
- **Warning**: Avoid building too many T1/T2 buildings - creates cash flow problems during refort/refit

### Building Strategy for Cash Flow
- **Downsize Method**: Downsize all forts and troops, then build (generates maximum cash)
- **Problem**: Wasteful turn usage rebuilding forts and retraining troops
- **Recommended**: Leave ~50% of scum during build cycles (after 10k+ acres)
- **Balance**: Maintain enough cash for refort/refit plus "rainy day" reserves

## Cash Management Guidelines

### Safe Cash Amounts
- **Formula**: Keep 1.0-1.5x total acreage in millions of cash
- **Example**: 20k acre realm = 20-30 million cash on hand
- **Logic**: If looted 5 times (15 million stolen), still have reserves for war operations

### Danger Zone
- **Risk**: Too much cash makes you a target for financial warfare
- **Example**: 250+ million cash realms can be looted to fund enemy super-fluffing
- **Consequence**: Enemy uses your own cash to break your defenses

### War Finance Allocation
- **War Preparation**: 33-50% of total cash for initial war setup
- **Operations**: Remaining cash for breaking realms and reforting
- **Critical**: Always maintain cash reserves for post-attack refortification

## Cash Protection Strategies

### Distribution
- **Guild-Wide**: Spread cash across guild members
- **Avoid**: One realm with 500M, others with 2M (creates single point of failure)
- **Exception**: King realm with 4x opponent land and 2x opponent structures

### Defensive Measures
- **Scum Protection**: Hire enough thieves so 80-90% of max-scum scouts are "seen"
- **Deterrent Effect**: Visible scum discourages casual theft attempts
- **War Reality**: During active war, cash will be targeted regardless of protection

## Excess Cash Management

### Options for Surplus
1. **Tithe Away**: Convert to land (often poor exchange rate)
2. **Cash Caravans**: Send to smaller guild realms for faster building
3. **Keep Moving**: Maintain cash flow throughout guild

### Risk Assessment
- **Example**: 10k acre realm with 60M cash and 200 green scum = overexposed
- **Responsibility**: Player fault for maintaining dangerous cash levels
- **Common Mistake**: Even veteran players make this error

## Strategic Applications

### War Strike Design
- **Scum/Sorcery First**: Generate excess cash from initial operations
- **Cash Transfer**: Pass war chest to warrior realms via caravans
- **Enhanced Aggression**: Warriors can take more risks with larger war chests

### Financial Warfare
- **Target Selection**: Identify cash-heavy opponents
- **Timing**: Strike before they can spend or distribute cash
- **Utilization**: Use captured cash immediately for counter-operations

## Key Principles

1. **Cash is Perishable**: Most fluid and vulnerable resource
2. **Balance Required**: Enough for operations, not enough to fund enemies
3. **Guild Coordination**: Distribute financial risk across multiple realms
4. **Turn Efficiency**: Avoid wasteful downsizing/rebuilding cycles
5. **War Readiness**: Maintain reserves for rapid response and refortification

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Hoarding excessive cash (250M+ on single realm)
- Poor scum protection relative to cash holdings
- Inadequate war chest distribution
- Wasteful building cycles requiring full military reconstruction
- Ignoring cash vulnerability during strike planning
