## Exact Building Ratios for 30k Acre Kingdoms

### Core Infrastructure Distribution
- **Quarries**: 30-35% of total structures (9,000-10,500 buildings)
- **Barracks**: 30-35% of total structures (9,000-10,500 buildings)  
- **Guildhalls**: 10% of total structures (3,000 buildings)
- **Hovels**: 10% of total structures (3,000 buildings)
- **Forts**: 5-6% of total structures (1,500-1,800 buildings)
- **Temples**: 12% of total structures (3,600 buildings)

### Build Rate Mechanics
- **Maximum Sustainable BR**: 26-28 without debt accumulation
- **Development Cost**: 310-325 gold per acre developed
- **Optimal BR Range**: 16-20 for most efficient building cycles
- **Turn Cost**: Each building action consumes 1 turn regardless of quantity

### Economic Calculations
- **T1/T2 Building Synergy**: Markets + Hovels built 1:1 ratio for maximum cash generation
- **Income Formula**: Base income × (1 + Guildhall_bonus) × (1 + Population_bonus)
- **Expense Formula**: (Military_upkeep + Building_maintenance) × Difficulty_modifier

## Detailed Turn Efficiency Analysis

### Building Cycle Example (27,357 acre Droben)
**Starting State**:
- Land: 27,357 acres
- Build Rate: 10 (inadequate)
- Open Acres: 13,795
- Available Turns: 450 (6 days × 75 turns/day)

**Cycle 1: BR Improvement (136 turns)**
- Downsize all defensive troops and scum for cash
- Build Waterfalls: 10 → 12 BR (22 turns)
- Build Waterfalls: 12 → 14 BR (114 turns)
- Result: 6,849 Waterfalls, BR 14

**Cycle 2: Further Enhancement (130 turns)**
- Reserve 20 turns for refortification
- Target: BR 16 (requires 1,359 additional structures)
- Waterfalls construction: 98 turns
- Diversification: 32 turns (167 TimoTon, 156 Baklavs, 189 RumaNa)
- Result: 8,212 Waterfalls, BR 16

**Cycle 3: War Preparation (150 turns)**
- Reserve: 18 turns refort + 32 turns Inspire Devotion
- Available: 100 turns building (1,600 structures capacity)
- Distribution: 237 Arches, 250 Enclaves, 1,113 RumaNa
- Strategy: RumaNa first, then Enclaves, then Arches
- Cash optimization: Inspire Devotion before fort construction

### Final Optimized State
- **Build Rate**: 16 (meets efficiency threshold)
- **Train Rate**: 3,000+ troops per turn set
- **Temple Count**: Sufficient for sorcery protection
- **Cash Generation**: Balanced for war operations

## Resource Management Formulas

### Cash Flow Calculations
- **Safe Cash Formula**: 1.0-1.5 × total_acreage in millions
- **Example**: 20k acre realm = 20-30 million safe cash reserve
- **War Allocation**: 33-50% of total cash for war preparation
- **Looting Risk**: 5 successful loots = ~15 million stolen

### Turn Acceleration Methods
- **Encamp 24 hours**: +10 bonus turns
- **Encamp 16 hours**: +7 bonus turns  
- **Total Bonus**: 17 turns for faster accumulation
- **Standard Rate**: 3 turns per hour base generation

## Combat Preparation Specifications

### Defensive Posture (Under 20k Acres)
- **Scum Allocation**: 50% of total military
- **Big Troops**: 50% T3/T4 defensive units
- **Detection Threshold**: 80-90% of max enemy scout attempts visible

### Defensive Posture (Over 20k Acres)
- **Add T1/T2 Troops**: Prevent Guerrilla Raids on scum
- **Layered Defense**: Multiple defensive unit tiers
- **Scum Protection**: Maintain detection while adding conventional defense

## Advanced Building Strategies

### Structure Categories by Vulnerability
**Permanent Structures** (survive most attacks):
- Quarries, Barracks, Hovels
- Maintain 60-70% of total building allocation

**Perishable Structures** (vulnerable to destruction):
- Guildhalls, Temples, Forts
- Maintain 30-40% of total building allocation
- Higher risk but essential for functionality

### Timing Optimization
- **Pre-War Building**: Complete 2-3 full cycles before conflict
- **Cash Management**: Build expensive structures when cash available
- **Inspire Devotion**: Use before fort construction to maximize cash efficiency
- **Refort Planning**: Always reserve 15-20 turns for military preparation

This level of detail preserves the exact mathematical relationships and specific formulas needed to recreate the authentic Monarchy building system with proper balance and strategic depth.
