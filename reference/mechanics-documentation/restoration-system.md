# Restoration System - Exact Technical Specifications

**Source**: NPAC Elite Forum Analysis - "Protips on War XIII : Restore"

## Restoration Timing Mechanics

### Damage-Based Restoration (48 Hours)
- **Trigger Condition**: Kingdom severely damaged but not eliminated
- **Duration**: Exactly 48 hours from damage occurrence
- **Damage Threshold**: Typically 70%+ structure loss or critical infrastructure destruction
- **Status**: Kingdom remains active but with restoration protection

### Death-Based Restoration (72 Hours)
- **Trigger Condition**: Kingdom completely eliminated (sorcery kill or total destruction)
- **Duration**: Exactly 72 hours from elimination
- **Death Status**: Kingdom shows as "DEAD" during restoration period
- **Revival**: Full restoration to pre-death state after 72 hours

## Restoration Capabilities and Limitations

### Allowed Actions During Restoration
- **Limited Building**: Can construct basic infrastructure
- **Encamp Usage**: Can use Encamp for turn acceleration
- **Resource Management**: Basic economic functions remain available
- **Communication**: Can participate in guild coordination

### Prohibited Actions During Restoration
- **No Combat**: Cannot attack or be attacked
- **No Sorcery**: Cannot cast spells or be targeted by magic
- **No Espionage**: Cannot conduct or receive scum operations
- **No Diplomacy**: Cannot send/receive caravans or formal diplomatic actions

## Strategic Implications

### Defensive Strategy Integration
- **Timing Advantage**: 48-hour window provides breathing room for guild recovery
- **Coordination**: Allows damaged realms to rebuild while others continue fighting
- **Resource Reallocation**: Guild can redistribute resources to functional realms

### Offensive Considerations
- **Turn Investment**: Sorcery kills require 160+ turns but remove target for 72 hours
- **Strategic Value**: Removing key enemy realms during critical war phases
- **Timing Calculation**: 72-hour removal vs turn investment analysis

## Restoration vs Sorcery Kill Economics

### Turn Investment Analysis
**Parking Lot** (94 turns total):
- **Immediate Effect**: Realm severely damaged but functional
- **Restoration**: 48 hours protection, partial capability maintained
- **Strategic Value**: Disrupts enemy operations, conserves turns

**Sorcery Kill** (160 turns total):
- **Immediate Effect**: Complete realm elimination
- **Restoration**: 72 hours complete removal from game
- **Strategic Value**: Total elimination during critical periods

### Cost-Benefit Calculations
- **PL Efficiency**: 94 turns for 48-hour disruption = 0.51 turns per hour
- **SK Efficiency**: 160 turns for 72-hour elimination = 2.22 turns per hour
- **Strategic Context**: SK preferred for critical targets, PL for resource efficiency

## Guild Warfare Applications

### Defensive War Timing
- **36-40 Hour Window**: Optimal peace negotiation timing before second enemy strike
- **Restoration Factor**: Damaged realms need 48 hours, limiting defensive options
- **Strategic Reality**: Beyond 48 hours, defender position deteriorates rapidly

### Offensive War Planning
- **First Strike Priority**: Eliminate key targets before they can restore
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance between PL (efficiency) and SK (elimination)
- **Timing Coordination**: Synchronize attacks to maximize restoration disruption

## Restoration Abuse Prevention

### System Limitations
- **One Restoration**: Cannot repeatedly trigger restoration protection
- **Damage Threshold**: Must meet minimum damage requirements
- **Time Limits**: Fixed duration prevents indefinite protection

### Strategic Counters
- **Delayed Attacks**: Wait for restoration to expire before follow-up
- **Alternative Targets**: Focus on non-restored realms during protection period
- **Resource Denial**: Prevent restoration realm from rebuilding effectively

## Mathematical Optimization

### Restoration Timing in War Cycles
- **War Duration**: Most guild wars resolve within 48-72 hours
- **Restoration Overlap**: Damaged realms may miss entire war resolution
- **Strategic Planning**: Factor restoration timing into war objectives

### Turn Efficiency During Restoration
- **Building Focus**: Use protection period for infrastructure development
- **Encamp Usage**: Accelerate turn generation for post-restoration readiness
- **Resource Accumulation**: Build war chest for immediate post-restoration operations

## Historical Context and Meta-Game Impact

### Pre-Restoration Era
- **Permanent Death**: Sorcery kills were permanent elimination
- **Higher Stakes**: Complete realm loss was irreversible
- **Strategic Caution**: More conservative gameplay due to permanent consequences

### Post-Restoration Era
- **Aggressive Tactics**: Restoration reduces permanent loss fear
- **Sorcery Kill Value**: 72-hour elimination still strategically valuable
- **War Dynamics**: Faster-paced conflicts with restoration safety net

## Advanced Restoration Strategies

### Coordinated Guild Restoration
- **Staggered Damage**: Ensure not all realms restore simultaneously
- **Resource Pooling**: Functional realms support restoration rebuilding
- **Communication Maintenance**: Restored realms provide intelligence and coordination

### Restoration Timing Manipulation
- **Controlled Damage**: Trigger restoration at optimal timing
- **Strategic Sacrifice**: Accept damage to gain restoration protection
- **War Phase Alignment**: Time restoration to coincide with enemy vulnerability

This complete specification preserves all restoration mechanics, exact timing values, and strategic implications needed to recreate the authentic Monarchy restoration system with proper balance and tactical depth.
