# Downsize Screen - Official Forum Documentation

**Source**: https://www.monarchygame.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=1740

## Overview
Fire military or scum, destroy fortresses, or abandon unbuilt land.

The downsize screen allows you to remove portions of your army, including fortifications. You are also able to downsize land by salting the earth to prevent it falling into the hands of the enemy, or by merely retreating to more manageable borders.

## Downsizing Troops

### Unit Selection
To fire units, you must:
1. Enter the amount of that particular troop type you want to downsize
2. Select their level of training in the pull down boxes

### Training Levels
- **Level 1 ('Green')**: Newly hired troops, weakest
- **Level 2-4 ('Veteran')**: Progressively more powerful
- **Level 5 ('Elite')**: Most powerful, considerable drain on economy

### Strategic Implications
Elite troops may defeat a green force which outnumbers them, but are also a considerable drain on the kingdom's economy.

### Economic Impact
Changes made to your income and expenses by downsizing troops will be **instantly seen** once the orders have been submitted.

## Downsizing Land

### Process
Simply enter the number of acres you wish to release and hit 'send'.

### Economic Impact Timeline
Any changes to your income and expenses due to the downsizing of land will take place **over the next few spent turns**, as:
- Peasants may leave your kingdom
- Expenses may come down due to better management of remaining land

## Why Downsize?

### Troops
**Peacetime Efficiency Strategy:**
- Spend peace-time turns on a kingdom that has no troops
- Drastically reduces expenses
- Creates larger gap between income and expenses
- Larger gold return per turn spent (or reduction in gold lost)
- Gold can be used to:
  - Re-purchase troops
  - Provide buffer for training
  - Offer for more land

### Fort Buildings
**Fort Economics:**
- Forts have high expenses cost
- Cost increases on a per-fort basis as you build more
- **Example**: 1 fort on a kingdom with 1% forts has less expenses than the same 1 fort on a kingdom with 20% forts

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Unlike troops, **not recommended** to downsize forts during peace time and rebuild
- Forts are not hired instantly like troops are
- Can be used to free up land when you need to build other building types

### Land
**Reasons to Downsize Land:**

1. **Build Rate Optimization**:
   - Reduce total land to increase build-rate
   - Build remaining land at faster pace

2. **Tactical Denial**:
   - Deny land to enemy during wartime
   - Prevent enemy from taking it and growing stronger
   - "Salting the earth" strategy
