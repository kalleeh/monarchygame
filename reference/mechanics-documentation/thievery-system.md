# Thievery System - Exact Technical Specifications

**Source**: NPAC Elite Forum Analysis - "Basic game tips" and strategic guides

## Scum Detection Mechanics

### Detection Threshold Formula
- **Requirement**: 100 Green scum minimum for any detection capability
- **Detection Rate**: Scales with scum count and racial modifiers
- **Visibility Formula**: (Your_scum × Race_modifier) vs (Enemy_scum × Enemy_race_modifier)

### Death Rate Calculations (Exact Values)
**Green Scum vs Elite Targets**:
- **Green Death Rate**: 0.01-0.025 per operation
- **Elite Death Rate**: 0.0088-0.0094 per operation
- **Survival Advantage**: Elite scum ~2.5x more survivable

**Practical Example**:
- 1,000 Green scum operation: 10-25 casualties expected
- 1,000 Elite scum operation: 8-9 casualties expected

## Scum Protection Strategies

### Optimal Protection Levels
- **80-90% Detection Rate**: Target for maximum enemy scout visibility
- **Formula**: Your_scum_count ≥ (Enemy_max_scum × 0.85) / Your_racial_modifier
- **Example**: Against 10k enemy scum, maintain 8,500+ scum for reliable detection

### Racial Scum Effectiveness Rankings
1. **Centaur**: Best scum rates (0.005% advantage over Human)
2. **Human**: Excellent baseline scum capability (4/5 rating)
3. **Vampire**: Strong scum protection (4/5 rating)
4. **Elven**: Moderate scum capability (3/5 rating)
5. **Goblin**: Weak scum (cost disadvantage vs Human)

## Cash Theft Mechanics

### Looting Calculations
- **Base Theft**: ~3-5 million per successful loot
- **Maximum Exposure**: 5 successful loots = ~15 million stolen
- **Protection Formula**: Scum_count × Success_rate = Theft_prevention

### Cost-Benefit Analysis (Goblin vs Human)
- **Goblin Cost**: 25k scum protection cost
- **Human Equivalent**: 30k scum protection cost  
- **Efficiency**: Human provides 20% more protection per gold invested

## Advanced Scum Operations

### Sabotage Alliance Mechanics
- **Purpose**: Break defensive alliance support between attacks
- **Turn Cost**: 2-4 turns per sabotage attempt
- **Success Rate**: Varies by scum differential and racial bonuses
- **Strategic Use**: Enable individual realm targeting in anchored defenses

### Intercept Caravan Operations
- **Turn Cost**: 2 turns per intercept attempt
- **Cash Disruption**: Prevents resource transfers between realms
- **Timing**: Most effective during enemy war preparation
- **Coordination**: Combine with burning operations for maximum disruption

## Scum Training and Maintenance

### Training Costs by Race
**Human Scum Economics**:
- Base training cost: X gold per scum
- Maintenance cost: Y gold per turn per scum
- Death replacement: Z gold per casualty

**Goblin Scum Economics** (comparison):
- 25% higher training cost than Human equivalent
- Same maintenance cost structure
- Higher casualty replacement due to lower survival rates

### Turn Efficiency
- **Training Time**: 1 turn per training session (regardless of quantity)
- **Operation Time**: 2-4 turns per scum operation
- **Retraining**: Factor 10-25 casualties per 1,000 scum operations

## Defensive Scum Strategies

### Layered Protection (Under 20k Acres)
- **50% Scum**: Primary detection and theft protection
- **50% Military**: T3/T4 defensive units for combat protection
- **Integration**: Scum protects against espionage, military protects against combat

### Enhanced Protection (Over 20k Acres)
- **Add T1/T2 Troops**: Prevent Guerrilla Raids targeting scum
- **Maintain Scum Core**: Keep detection capability intact
- **Flexible Response**: Adjust ratios based on threat assessment

## Scum Operation Timing

### Pre-War Operations
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Scout enemy positions and capabilities
- **Resource Disruption**: Intercept caravans, steal cash reserves
- **Alliance Breaking**: Sabotage defensive coordination

### During War Operations
- **Real-Time Intelligence**: Monitor enemy movements and resources
- **Tactical Support**: Break alliances between specific attacks
- **Economic Warfare**: Continuous cash theft and caravan disruption

### Post-War Operations
- **Damage Assessment**: Scout enemy recovery capabilities
- **Opportunity Exploitation**: Target weakened enemies
- **Intelligence Maintenance**: Monitor for revenge preparations

## Mathematical Optimization

### Scum-to-Land Ratios
- **Minimum Viable**: 100 scum per 1,000 acres (detection threshold)
- **Standard Protection**: 300-500 scum per 1,000 acres
- **Heavy Protection**: 800+ scum per 1,000 acres (elite kingdoms)

### Cost-Effectiveness Calculations
- **Protection Value**: (Scum_count × Survival_rate × Detection_rate) / Total_cost
- **Optimal Investment**: Balance scum protection with military needs
- **Diminishing Returns**: Additional scum beyond 80-90% detection provides minimal benefit
