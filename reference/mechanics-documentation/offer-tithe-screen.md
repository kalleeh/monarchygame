# Offer (Tithe) Screen - Official Forum Documentation

**Source**: https://www.monarchygame.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=1739

## Overview
Offer gold in exchange for land.

Offering enough money to the church of your chosen deity will benefit your kingdom.

## Rewards

### Primary Reward
**Land Grants**: Most direct and common reward - expansion of kingdom borders

### Additional Rewards
Continued donation of sizeable sums may result in:
- **Trained Military Units**: Arrive to join your armies
- **Architects**: Construct more buildings free of charge
- **Divine Blessing**: Direct blessing from your god

## Mechanics

### Donation Limits
- Gods love generous givers, but have strategic aims
- **Limits placed on donation size** until kingdom is deemed large enough
- Must increase tithe size to gain benefits
- If donation not sizeable enough: church accepts money but provides no reward

### Strategic Purpose
Gods aim to win control of Tonan through force - they support kingdoms that can contribute to this goal.

## Early Game Strategy

### Most Efficient Land Acquisition
At the start of each game, when:
- Kingdoms are small
- Players concentrate on building rather than warfare
- **Offering (tithing) is the easiest and most efficient way of expanding borders**

### Efficiency Decline
As kingdoms grow larger, tithing becomes less efficient compared to military conquest.
