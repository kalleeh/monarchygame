# Bounty System - Exact Technical Specifications

**Source**: NPAC Elite Forum Analysis - "Protips on War XII : Bounties"

## Bounty Efficiency Mathematics

### Land Acquisition Calculations
**Sorcery Kill Example** (30,000 acre target):
- **Land Gained**: 9,000 acres (30% of target realm)
- **Structure Bonus**: ~1,800 built structures (~20% built ratio)
- **Turn Savings**: 100+ turns equivalent at BR 18
- **Total Value**: 9,000 acres + 1,800 structures + 100 turns saved

### Comparison to Traditional Warfare
- **Current War Gains**: "Low level" land acquisition for warriors
- **Bounty Premium**: Superior turn-to-land ratio in current meta
- **Structure Quality**: Random distribution vs minimally built war captures
- **Optimal Draws**: Quarries provide maximum strategic value

## Advanced Bounty Strategies

### Shared Kill Mechanics
- **95% Rule**: Sorcerer reduces target to 95% elimination
- **Warrior Finish**: Warrior delivers final blow for land acquisition
- **Dual Benefit**: Sorcerer claims bounty, warrior gains land
- **NPC Targeting**: Extremely effective against computer-controlled realms

### Bounty Collection Timing

#### Tithing Exhaustion Threshold
- **Start Point**: After all tithing bonuses exhausted during building
- **Typical Range**: 11k-15k acres for most races
- **Efficiency Signal**: When tithing no longer provides cost-effective land gains
- **Strategic Window**: Begin bounty hunting at this development stage

#### Environmental Assessment Matrix
**Current Meta Analysis** (3 major guilds, 3 minor guilds):
- **Opportunity Window**: When 2 of 3 major guilds engaged in warfare
- **Risk Calculation**: 250 turns for 4k acres vs immediate war threat
- **Strategic Timing**: Maximize "time off award" during others' conflicts
- **Competitive Positioning**: Maintain pace with war-gained kingdoms

## Bounty Claiming Strategies

### Immediate Claiming (Standard Protocol)
- **Default Action**: Claim bounties immediately upon collection
- **Benefits**: Immediate kingdom development and growth
- **Risk Level**: Minimal under normal circumstances
- **Resource Integration**: Instant access to land and structures

### Strategic Holding (Advanced Tactics)
**Defensive War Scenario**:
- **Hold Condition**: Cannot protect newly claimed bounty during active defense
- **Protection Assessment**: Evaluate ability to defend additional territory
- **Recovery Options**: 
  1. **Post-War Recovery**: Claim for kingdom restoration
  2. **Semi-Secret Weapon**: Deploy during first strike operations

### Semi-Secret Weapon Deployment
- **Tactical Advantage**: Unclaimed bounty provides unaccounted capability
- **Detection Risk**: Competent AGM of War/GM monitor kill lists constantly
- **Surprise Factor**: Major tactical advantage if successfully concealed
- **Optimal Usage**: Deploy during critical first strike operations

## Bounty Value Calculations

### Land-to-Turn Efficiency
**Traditional Building**:
- **Tithing**: Diminishing returns after 11k-15k acres
- **War Acquisition**: Low current land gains per turn invested
- **Building Costs**: High gold and turn investment for expansion

**Bounty Collection**:
- **Sorcery Kill**: 160 turns for 9,000 acres (56.25 acres per turn)
- **Structure Bonus**: 1,800 structures included (no additional building required)
- **Quality Variance**: Random structure types, potential for high-value draws

### Economic Impact Analysis
- **Cash Investment**: Minimal compared to traditional expansion
- **Turn Efficiency**: Superior to all other land acquisition methods
- **Resource Multiplier**: Structures included amplify total value
- **Strategic Positioning**: Maintains competitiveness with war-active guilds

## Meta-Game Integration

### Guild War Dynamics
- **First Strike Advantage**: Attackers typically gain 1-2 large kingdoms
- **Competitive Response**: Bounties enable non-war guilds to maintain pace
- **Post-War Positioning**: Stay competitive for next conflict cycle
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance bounty hunting with war preparation

### Intelligence Warfare
- **Enemy Monitoring**: Track opponent bounty collection and claims
- **Unclaimed Tracking**: Monitor for semi-secret weapon potential
- **Strategic Planning**: Factor enemy bounty capabilities into war plans
- **Communication**: Coordinate bounty timing with guild strategy

## Bounty System Optimization

### Collection Efficiency
- **Target Selection**: Prioritize high-value, achievable targets
- **Turn Investment**: Balance collection effort with strategic value
- **Resource Management**: Maintain war readiness while bounty hunting
- **Timing Coordination**: Align collection with guild strategic needs

### Claiming Optimization
- **Immediate vs Delayed**: Assess protection capability and strategic timing
- **Resource Integration**: Plan for immediate development of claimed territory
- **Defense Preparation**: Ensure ability to protect expanded kingdom
- **Strategic Surprise**: Evaluate semi-secret weapon potential

## Historical Context and Evolution

### Current Game State Impact
- **Low War Gains**: Traditional warfare yields minimal land acquisition
- **Bounty Premium**: Higher relative value due to reduced alternatives
- **Strategic Necessity**: Guilds "extremely foolish" not to utilize bounties
- **Competitive Requirement**: Essential for maintaining guild competitiveness

### Future Considerations
- **Meta Shifts**: Bounty value may change with game balance updates
- **Strategic Adaptation**: Adjust bounty strategies based on war gain changes
- **Community Evolution**: Bounty tactics will evolve with player base

This complete specification preserves all bounty mechanics, exact efficiency calculations, and strategic applications needed to recreate the authentic Monarchy bounty system with proper balance and competitive depth.
