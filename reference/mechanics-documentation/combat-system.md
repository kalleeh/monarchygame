# Combat System - Exact Mathematical Specifications

**Source**: NPAC Elite Forum Analysis - Multiple strategic guides (2010-2014)

## Full Strike Land Acquisition Formula

### Base Land Calculation
- **Full Strike Range**: 6.79%-7.35% of target's total land
- **Scaling Factor**: Networth difference affects percentage within range
- **Success Modifier**: "With ease" results take higher percentage (7.0-7.35%)
- **Resistance Modifier**: "Good fight" results take lower percentage (6.79-7.0%)

### Controlled Strike Mechanics
- **CS1**: Targets 1% of enemy land, used for testing defenses
- **CS100**: Targets 100% of enemy land, used for major assaults
- **Progression Strategy**: CS1 until "with ease" 2x, then CS100 until "with ease" 2x, then Full Strike

## Warrior Race Combat Values (Exact Rankings)

### Tier 1: Elite Warriors
1. **Droben** (Best Overall)
   - Bunar: 27.50 attack value (T3 unit)
   - Summon: 3.04% of total networth in Green T1 troops
   - T1 Guerrilla: 25.0 attack value
   - Example: 1M networth = 30,400 summoned troops

2. **Elemental** (Second Best)
   - War Offense: 4/5 rating
   - T4 Advantage: Easiest high-value unit training
   - Summon: 2.84% of networth (second best)

3. **Goblin** (Third)
   - War Offense: 4/5 rating (tied with Elemental/Dwarven)
   - T4 vs T3: Goblin T4 (22.50) vs Dwarf T3 (22.50) - saves turns
   - Summon: 2.75% (tied with Dwarven)
   - Growth advantage: Better Offer ability

4. **Dwarven** (Fourth)
   - War Offense: 4/5 rating
   - T3 Training: More turn-intensive than Goblin T4
   - Summon: 2.75% (tied with Goblin)

### Combat Efficiency Examples
**Goblin vs Dwarven Comparison** (equal resources):
- Goblin: 13.5k acres, T4 units, 146 turns after conversion
- Dwarven: 11.5k acres, T3 units, 142 turns after conversion
- **Result**: 2k acre advantage to Goblin due to efficiency

## The "Rule of 0.25%" - Cash Conservation

### Mathematical Progression
After achieving "with ease" status, reduce army by 25% each attack while maintaining effectiveness:

**Example** (Human Dragons, starting 4,000 T4):
- Attack 1: 4,000 Dragons
- Attack 2: 3,000 Dragons (25% reduction)
- Attack 3: 2,250 Dragons (25% reduction)
- Attack 4: 1,688 Dragons (25% reduction)
- Attack 5: 1,266 Dragons (25% reduction)
- Attack 6: 950 Dragons (25% reduction)
- Attack 7: 713 Dragons (25% reduction)

**Result**: Each attack maintains "with ease" while progressively reducing costs

## Defense Point Calculations

### Fort Defense Values by Race
- **Goblin Forts**: 285 defense points each
- **Standard Calculation**: Fort_count × Race_modifier = Total_fort_defense
- **Troop Integration**: Fort_defense + Troop_defense = Total_defensive_points

### Example Defense Calculation (21k Goblin)
**Before Sorcery**:
- 3,300 Trolls: 321,500 defense points
- 1,048 Forts: 298,680 defense points  
- **Total**: 620,180 defense points
- **CS1 Requirement**: 6,900 Giants for "Good Fight"

**After Sorcery** (forts reduced to 535):
- 3,300 Trolls: 321,500 defense points (unchanged)
- 535 Forts: 152,475 defense points
- **Total**: 473,975 defense points  
- **CS1 Requirement**: 2,200 Giants for "Good Fight"

## Ambush Mechanics

### Effectiveness Rates
- **Success Rate**: 95% effectiveness against organized attacks
- **Counter Strategy**: Guerrilla Raid or Full Attack during enemy conversion
- **Detection**: Assume all opponents have ambush unless proven otherwise
- **Guild Impact**: Especially devastating in coordinated guild warfare

### Ambush Removal Protocol
1. **Scout Target**: Confirm ambush presence (2 turns)
2. **Guerrilla Raid**: Low-risk ambush removal attempt (4 turns)
3. **Alternative**: Full Attack during enemy conversion phase
4. **Verification**: Re-scout to confirm ambush removal (2 turns)

## Summon Troop Optimization

### Networth Inflation Strategy
**Components affecting summon calculation**:
- Base networth from buildings and land
- **Cash Multiplier**: Liquid cash × inflation_factor
- **T1 Building Bonus**: Guildhalls provide higher networth inflation than temples/quarries

**Advanced Tactic**:
- Send large cash reserves to Droben
- Build extra Guildhalls for networth inflation
- **Result**: Massive summon capability (potentially 40,000+ troops)
- **Risk**: Vulnerability to burning (T1 buildings) and looting (cash)

## Multi-Realm Attack Coordination

### "Pass the Plate" Mechanics
1. **Primary Warrior**: Breaks target to first "with ease" Full Attack
2. **Handoff Protocol**: Pass target to next biggest warrior
3. **Land Distribution**: Each warrior takes optimal land amount
4. **Efficiency**: Continue until all warriors benefit or target exhausted

### Turn Investment Analysis
- **Solo Breaking**: 94 turns (50 prep + 44 sorcery) for 21k acre neutralization
- **Multi-Realm**: 2 attackers neutralize 3 enemy realms
- **Exchange Rate**: Favorable 2:3 ratio in organized warfare

This technical specification preserves the exact formulas and mathematical relationships needed to recreate authentic Monarchy combat mechanics with proper balance and strategic depth.
