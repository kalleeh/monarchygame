# Hire Screen - Official Forum Documentation

**Source**: https://www.monarchygame.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=1742

## Overview
The Hire screen allows you to increase the size of your armies, and also to hire scum to perform black ops such as scouting your enemies or wreaking havoc in their kingdoms.

## Troop Types (T1-T5 System)
Although each race has troops with different names and prices, they are always presented in the same order:
- **T1, T2, T3, T4**: Military troops (used in War attack calculations)
- **T5**: Scum troops (used in Thievery attack calculations)

Military troops get progressively more expensive from T1 to T4, but with increased cost comes increased raw strength. 1:1 T3 or T4 will always be stronger than T1 or T2.

## Troop Cap System

### Cap Calculation
Your troop cap is based on the **accumulated gold cost** of the troops you have hired. There is a limit to how many troops and fortresses a kingdom can hold.

### Strategic Implications
Even though stronger T3/T4 troops have greater 1:1 raw power than T1/T2, it may actually be better to hire cheaper troops due to the gold-based cap.

### Example: Human Kingdom (Pikemen vs Knights)
**Troop Stats:**
- **Pikemen**: 2,000 gold, 40 defense (T2)
- **Knights**: 4,500 gold, 82.5 defense (T4)

**At 1:1 ratio**: Knights appear superior (82.5 vs 40 defense)

**With 10,000,000 gold troop cap:**
- **5,000 Pikemen**: Combined defense = 200,000
- **2,222 Knights**: Combined defense = 183,315

**Result**: Pikemen provide 9% more defensive power despite lower individual stats.

### Training Considerations
With imaginary train rate of 1,000:
- **5,000 Pikemen**: 20 turns to train to level 5
- **2,222 Knights**: 9 turns to train to level 5

**Strategic Decision**: Is having 11 additional turns worth more than a 9% reduction in raw defensive power?

## Upkeep Costs
Each unit has an upkeep cost. Even though you may afford the initial purchase price, ongoing expenses may bankrupt your kingdom. Troops who are not paid due to lack of money will quickly desert.

## Price Display
The screen displays:
- Price of each unit
- How many troops you can afford with current treasury
