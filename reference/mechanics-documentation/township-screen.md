# Township Screen - Official Forum Documentation

**Source**: https://www.monarchygame.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=1743

## Overview
The township screen allows you to turn your open land into functional buildings. Each race names their buildings differently, but they all have the same effect upon your kingdom.

## Building Process
1. Enter the number of specific building(s) you want to construct
2. Hit the submit button
3. As long as you have enough turns, open land, and cash, buildings are constructed instantly

## Six Building Types

### 1. Income Buildings (Guildhalls, Markets, Smithies, etc.)
**Race-Specific Names**: Guildhalls, Markets, Smithies, TimoTon, Underwoods, Slave Markets, Trinket Shops, Wagons, Gem Mines, Dolmen

**Function**: Places where merchants ply their trade and attract extra income to your kingdom.

**Benefits**: Single most efficient way of increasing income

**Vulnerability**: Can be sabotaged by enemy spies

**Quantity Recommendation**: No more than 10% of your land

### 2. Peasant Buildings (Hovels, Lodges, Dens, etc.)
**Race-Specific Names**: Hovels, Lodges, Dens, Baklavs, Tombs, Charging Cells, Hollowed Oaks, Tents, Caves, Brambles

**Function**: Provide lodging for your population who provide workforce and consumers for your economy.

**Quantity Recommendation**: Approximately 10% of your land

### 3. Troop Buildings (Barracks, Garrisons, etc.)
**Race-Specific Names**: Barracks, Garrisons, Barrak, RumaNa, Great Halls, Cages, Thickets, Sacred Fields, Caverns, Henges

**Function**: Provide lodging and training resources for your armies.

**Benefits**:
1. Increase training rate (TRT) - train more troops per turn
2. Enable you to hold greater number of troops on same land

**Function**: Allow you to build more structures per turn.

**Benefits**: Invaluable when repairing damage or starting the game

**Mechanics**: BRT directly tied to percentage of kingdom given to this building type. BRT starts at 4 structures per turn, increases incrementally every 5%.

**Quantity Recommendation**:
- 80% until 3,000 built
- 40% during next few days building
- Ideally 25-35% after

### 5. Magic Buildings (Temples, Groves, Shrines, etc.)
**Race-Specific Names**: Temples, Groves, Shrines, Enclaves, Focus Points, Casting Pits, Fires, Magick Circles, Sanctums, Cairns

- Treated like a troop (can be trained or downsized/demolished)

**Vulnerability**: Can be destroyed by enemy attacks

**Quantity Recommendation**: No more than 5-10%

## Buildrate (BRT) System

### How BRT Works
BRT determines the number of structures that can be built using a single turn.

**Example with BRT of 10:**
- Build 10 buildings of same type in 1 turn
- OR divide: 5 troop buildings + 5 fort buildings
- OR: 5 BRT buildings + 1 of each other type
- Building 9 structures still costs 1 turn (wasted potential)
- Building 11 structures costs 2 turns (could have built 9 more)

### BRT Percentage Table
For every 5% of total kingdom in BRT buildings, your BRT increases:

| Land % in BRT Buildings | BRT per Turn |
|------------------------|--------------|
| 0 - 4.999% | 4 |
| 5 - 9.999% | 6 |
| 10 - 14.999% | 8 |
| 15 - 19.999% | 10 |
| 20 - 24.999% | 12 |
| 25 - 29.999% | 14 |
| 30 - 34.999% | 16 |
| 35 - 39.999% | 18 |
| 40 - 44.999% | 19 |
| 45 - 49.999% | 20 |
| 50 - 54.999% | 21 |
| 55 - 59.999% | 22 |
| 60 - 64.999% | 23 |
| 65 - 69.999% | 24 |
| 70 - 74.999% | 25 |
| 75 - 79.999% | 26 |
| 80 - 84.999% | 27 |
| 85 - 89.999% | 28 |
| 90 - 94.999% | 29 |
| 95 - 99.999% | 30 |
| 100% | 31 |

*Note: At 100% there would be no empty land to build on*

## Gaining Additional Land

### Two Main Methods:
1. **Offer (Tithe)**: Offer gold to the church for additional acres
   - Best way to grow in the beginning
   - Becomes less efficient as kingdom grows larger

2. **Military Conquest**: Attack with armies to gain land through War
