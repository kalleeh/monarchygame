# Training Screen - Official Forum Documentation

**Source**: https://www.monarchygame.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=1741

## Overview
This screen allows you to train your military units, scum units, and fortresses to increase their effectiveness both when attacking other kingdoms and defending your own.

## Training Mechanics

### Unit Selection
The number of units available to train is displayed next to each troop type. You can select some or all by:
1. Typing the amount in the box
2. Choosing the target level to train them to
3. Hitting 'train'

### Quality Indicators
On Kingdom summary screens, scout reports, and UB, you'll see quality indicators:
- **Green (G)**: Average level close to 1
- **Veteran (V)**: Average level between 1 and 5
- **Elite (E)**: Average level close to 5

## Train Rate System

### How Train Rate Works
Displayed at the bottom of the screen is the number of units you can train per turn.

**Example with 100 train rate:**
- Move 100 units from level 1 to level 2 in one turn
- OR move 25 troops from level 1 to level 5 in one turn
- OR any combination using up to 100 training points

### Increasing Train Rate
Build more troop buildings (Barracks, etc.) using the Township screen.

## Optimal Training Strategy

### Efficiency Best Practices
Most veteran players advise:
1. **Spend one turn at a time** (most efficient)
2. **Train lower level troops first** before higher level troops
3. **Train cheaper troops first** before expensive ones
4. **Minimize expenses** for as long as possible to maximize gold generation

### Example Training Order
With train rate of 100, kingdom has 500 level 1 thieves and 500 level 1 pikemen:
1. Train 100 thieves from level 1 to level 2 (repeat 5 times)
2. Train 100 pikemen from level 1 to level 2 (repeat 5 times)
3. Switch back to thieves, train from level 2 to level 3
4. Continue pattern

## Upkeep Cost Management

### Critical Warning
Training troops **increases their upkeep cost**, which increases your expenses. Your income, expenses, and treasury are displayed on this screen to monitor your economy.

### Danger of Multi-Turn Training
**Example Problem:**
- Train rate: 100
- Decision: Train 1,000 troops from level 1 to level 5 in one go
- Turns required: 40 turns (4,000 levels ÷ 100 train rate)
- **Risk**: Cannot stop once begun
- **Calculation**: Per-turn income/expenses based on **final expenses**

### Bankruptcy Risk
If expenses become higher than income:
- You lose gold equal to (expenses - income) **per turn**
- If you run out of gold during training, troops will not be paid
- Unpaid troops **desert your kingdom**
- Possible outcome: Zero gold, huge troop loss, no turns left to fix it

## Strategic Turn Management

### Leaving Turns for Re-training
It may seem counter-intuitive to:
1. Spend gold hiring troops
2. Spend turns training them
3. Downsize them a couple days later

**But this is optimal strategy:**
- Downsize troops first when doing peacetime actions
- Rehire and retrain at the end of your turn set
- Troops cost a lot in expenses
- Building without them generates enough gold to buy them back AND provide gold pool for Offer/War

### Turn Reserves
**Always leave 20-30 turns** to:
- Purchase and re-train troops after building
- OR purchase and train defensive troops after attacking

**Risk**: Spending all turns leaves kingdom without military protection.
