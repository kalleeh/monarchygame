### Combat System (War Screen)

**Core Combat Mechanics:**
- All war functions cost **4 turns** (increases if target's networth is markedly different)
- Multiple attack types available
- After 3 offensive actions against a target, official war declaration required

**Attack Types:**

1. **Controlled Strike**
   - Pits your entire force against a fraction of their armies
   - Higher acreage aimed for = higher proportion of enemy army faced
   - Must enter "acreage to seize" amount
   - More likely to succeed and take land

2. **Guerilla Raiding**
   - Sends type 1 & 2 troops + thieves against equivalent enemy forces
   - Kills troops and enemy peasants if successful
   - **No land is ever taken** in guerilla raids

3. **Mob Assault**
   - Pits entire army + peasantry against enemy defenses
   - More potent offensive but harms economy if peasants killed
   - Seizes less land than successful full attack

4. **Full Attack**
   - Army vs army in pitched battle
   - Takes more land than any other method if successful

**Defensive Options:**
- **Set Ambush** - Increases defense potency for next incoming attack (costs 4 turns, must be manually reset)

### Magic System (Sorcery Screen)

**Core Magic Mechanics:**
- Powered by **'elan'** resource
- More temples = more elan gained per turn
- Building more temples unlocks more spells (up to 6 total)
- **Backlash** risk when casting offensive spells (destroys temples, costs elan and turns)
- All spells cost **2 turns** to cast

**Spell List (in unlock order):**

1. **Calming Chant** (Available to all)
   - Cost: 2 turns, no elan
   - Effect: Temporary income increase + grants 1 elan per casting
   - Can use "repeat" box for multiple castings

2. **Awakened Spirits** 
   - Cost: 10 elan, 2 turns
   - Effect: Summons ghostly 'type one' soldiers for one action
   - Troops are 'green' quality, don't benefit allies
   - More troops provided for larger kingdoms

3. **Shattering Calm** (Offensive)
   - Cost: 20 elan, 2 turns
   - Effect: Targets enemy peasants and temples for destruction
   - More powerful if you have considerably more temples than opponent

4. **Wild Design** (Defensive)
   - Cost: 40 elan, 2 turns
   - Effect: Blocks single incoming Shattering Calm or Banshee Deluge
   - Can stack multiple Wild Designs

5. **Blazing Noise** (Defensive, aka 'fog')
   - Cost: 60 elan, 2 turns
   - Effect: Random chance to deflect enemy war and steal actions
   - Lasts 24 hours before fading

6. **Banshee Deluge** (Most powerful offensive)
   - Cost: 80 elan, 2 turns
   - Effect: Targets entirety of enemy's township
   - Capable of devastation if you have considerably more temples than opponent

### Alliance System

**Alliance Mechanics:**
- Available in all games except Solo mode
- Each kingdom can have up to **3 allies** at any time
- Alliances must be between kingdoms of the same faith
- Alliance offers sent via kingdom number, appear in target's Scribe screen

**Alliance Support Types:**

1. **Military Aid** (Offensive & Defensive)
   - Patrols (lowest support)
   - Supplement vanguard (medium support)  
   - Dispatch army (highest support)
   - Supporting allies doesn't diminish your own defenses
   - Your forces may suffer losses while aiding allies

2. **Financial Support**
   - Send portion of treasury to allies
   - Transfer is instant
   - Can be intercepted by enemies using 'intercept caravan' steal function
   - **Limit: One shipment per kingdom per 24 hours**

**War Declarations:**
- Can declare war on enemies through Alliance screen
- Required after 3 offensive actions against same target

### Thievery System (Scum Operations)

**Core Mechanics:**
- Uses race-specific thief units: citites, changelings, drow, satyrs, shakes, or aswang
- Success depends on having more thieves than the target
- Large thief advantage allows covert operations (target doesn't know who attacked)
- All actions cost 2+ turns (scales with networth difference)

**Thief Operations:**

1. **Loot** - Steal gold directly from enemy treasury
2. **Rob Guildhalls** - Destroy enemy economic buildings, forcing repair costs
3. **Spread Dissention** - Kill enemy peasants (can destroy kingdom if enough peasants die)
4. **Sabotage Alliances** - Remove alliance support for one enemy action
5. **Intercept Caravans** - Set ambush to steal money sent between allies
6. **Desecrate Temples** - Destroy enemy temples, reducing sorcery defense and offense

**Strategic Implications:**
- Economic warfare through guildhall destruction and gold theft
- Population warfare through peasant elimination
- Diplomatic warfare through alliance sabotage
- Magical warfare through temple destruction
- Intelligence warfare through caravan interception

### Resource & Turn System

**Turn Mechanics:**
- Turns are the primary action currency
- Different actions cost different amounts of turns
- War actions: 4 turns (modified by networth differences)
- Magic spells: 2 turns each
- Turn accumulation over time
- New Player Protection (NPP) provides turn bonuses

**Key Resources:**
- **Gold** - Primary currency for buildings, units, etc.
- **Population** - Peasants for economy and mob assaults
- **Land** - Territory for buildings and expansion
- **Elan** - Magic resource from temples
- **Networth** - Overall kingdom value/score

### Building & Economic System

**Township Features:**
- Construct new buildings for kingdom
- Buildings provide various benefits (economic, military, magical)
- Temples generate elan for magic system
- Building construction requires resources and turns

**Economic Mechanics:**
- Income/expense tracking
- Treasury management
- Resource generation from buildings and population
- Economic efficiency metrics
- Trade and resource exchange systems

### Military System

**Unit Types:**
- Multiple troop types with different capabilities

- 'Green' quality troops (from magic)
- Professional military units
- Thieves/Scum for black operations

**Military Management:**
- **Hire** - Recruit new military units and scum

- Points, kills, turns absorbed tracking
- Hall of Fame for top performers

**Scoring Metrics:**
- Networth (primary score)
- Military effectiveness
- Economic performance
- Magical power
- Alliance contributions

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Key Game Balance Elements

1. **Turn Economy** - All actions cost turns, creating strategic resource management
2. **Risk/Reward** - Higher reward actions (like magic) have risks (backlash)
3. **Scaling Costs** - Attack costs scale with networth differences
4. **Time Gates** - 24-hour limits on certain actions prevent abuse
5. **Cooperative Elements** - Alliance system encourages teamwork
6. **Information Warfare** - Intelligence systems create strategic depth

### Modern Implementation Considerations

1. **Real-time vs Turn-based** - Original uses turn-based system with time accumulation
2. **Complex Interdependencies** - Many systems interact (temples→elan→spells→combat effectiveness)
3. **Social Features** - Heavy emphasis on player interaction and diplomacy
4. **Progression Depth** - Multiple advancement paths (military, economic, magical, diplomatic)
5. **Faction System** - Faith-based groupings affect alliances and interactions

## Correlation with Current Game Data Structure

This forum analysis reveals several areas where your current `game-data/` structure could be enhanced:

### Missing Elements to Consider Adding:

1. **Thievery System Data**
   - Thief unit definitions by race (citites, changelings, drow, satyrs, shakes, aswang)
   - Six thief operations with costs, effects, and success mechanics
   - Covert operation thresholds and detection mechanics

2. **Magic System Data**
   - Spell definitions with costs, effects, and requirements
   - Elan generation and temple mechanics
   - Backlash probability and effects

3. **Alliance System Data**
   - Alliance types and limitations
   - Support level definitions
   - Diplomatic action types

4. **Combat System Expansion**
   - Multiple attack types with different mechanics
   - Defensive options (ambush, fog spells)
   - Turn cost calculations based on networth differences

5. **Intelligence Systems**
   - Information sharing mechanics
   - Scouting and reconnaissance features
   - War tracking and history

6. **Economic Complexity**
   - Building interdependencies
   - Resource generation formulas
   - Economic efficiency calculations

### Key Systems Integration

The forum analysis shows that Monarchy's systems are deeply interconnected:

- **Temples** generate elan for magic, but can be destroyed by thieves or war
- **Peasants** provide economic base but can be eliminated by thief operations
- **Alliances** provide military/economic support but can be sabotaged
- **Guildhalls** drive economy but are vulnerable to thief attacks
- **Networth** affects turn costs for all aggressive actions
- **Faith** determines alliance eligibility and racial interactions

This analysis shows that Monarchy is far more complex than typical strategy games, with deep interconnected systems that create emergent gameplay. The modernization should preserve this complexity while making it more accessible through better UI/UX.
